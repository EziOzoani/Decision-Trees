# Decision-Trees
Data analytics 

Response is the target variable to be predicted using the other variable, i.e. X1-X8 and Y1-Y8.
X variables are the actual measurements. Y variables are the categorical form of the X variables based of the 
recommended cut-off points by the previous studies. Group is the variable that might moderate the predictability of 
response by Xs or Ys.

The purpose of this study is to use “Decision Trees” to assess predictability of Response by X, Y or combination of them. 
As mentioned in above, this predictability might be affected by the Group variable, and therefore the analysis should be 
performed for all cases, as well as for each group separately to study the effect of variable Group.
